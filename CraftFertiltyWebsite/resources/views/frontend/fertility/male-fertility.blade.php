    <x-image img="images/fertlity2.jpg"/>
   
    <x-paragraph>

        It's important to note that a live childbirth from men with absolutely zero sperm count is scientifically and biologically implausible under normal circumstances.<br>
        A zero sperm count (azoospermia) typically means the absence of sperm in the semen. Without sperm, natural conception is not possible.

        <br>However, advancements in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) have provided options for men with azoospermia to become biological fathers through techniques <br>such as testicular sperm extraction (TESE) or microdissection testicular sperm extraction (Micro-TESE), followed by in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

        To address the increased male infertility complications, CRAFT has a fully-fledged Andrology and Sexology department, headed by Dr. Sandeep Prabhakaran MS (PGI) MCh-Urology (SGPGI) Consultant Uro Andrologist & Sexologist. CRAFT is the only centre in India to do Micro TESE-ICSI, which is very effectively used in case of Non-obstructive Azoospermia, where the conventional TESE-ICSI or PESA–ICSI are not effective. We had several successful pregnancies for women with partners who were strongly advised for donor or with failed donor IVF cycles

    We use advance technology of sperm and embryo freezing namely “Vitrification” -this cryopreservation technique uses most advance technology around the world. This help us to offer the patients with best survival rates compared to slow freezing. This also helps in developmental potential of oocytes and embryos similar to fresh ones. The advanced technology and expert team in our lab gets you to high survival rates for your gametes and embryo.

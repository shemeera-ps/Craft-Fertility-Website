With the latest advancements in cancer therapy, this deadly disease can be cured by a combination treatment involving surgery and/or chemotherapy.

CRAFT offers fertility preservation options for post pubertal male (sperm cryopreservation) and post menarche female (oocyte cryopreservation, embryo cryopreservation and ovarian tissue preservation),
            thus expanding the range of possibilities for parenthood in future.
